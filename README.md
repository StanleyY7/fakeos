### Bonus Features

I added several bonus features into the project. These features are:

- Full Scalability/Responsiveness from 4k (2560 x 1375) down to Galaxy Fold Resolution Size.
- Made dragging work on mobile/tablet interfaces.
- Mimicked IOS dock for mobile/tablet interfaces.
- From a design perspective made sure it all had the same general theme, I created certain icons, logos whilst referring to reference images etc...
- Ensured that every button or entity that would be clicked did "something" (links to external pages, modals etc..). In future I will aim to replace as many external links as possible with my own project links or modals of my own projects.
- Mimicked start up loading screen for Mac OSX Yosemite. (I included startup chime as well upon startup page load).
