## Outline
The main aim of this project was to further consolidate our understanding of HTML, CSS/SCSS and Javascript. This project involved looking at a reference image of an OS and replicating it. I chose to base my project around several images (shown in the Reference Images section) and therefore I based my design off the Mac OSX (version 10.10) Yosemite.

### Reference Images

### Features
- Single Page Application.
- Desktop has a wallpaper that fits the viewport.
- There is selectable icons/apps. 
- Selecting an icon/app will open it, creating a modal to display some content.
- Ability to close an app and later to re-open it. 
- A selectable menu.
- Selecting the menu will display a list of text and icons. 
- Current time is displayed on the top-right as per the reference image, as well it updates in real-time.

## MVP
The main requirements for this project were:

### HTML/SCSS
 - Wallpaper scales to fit the viewport
 - Minimum 3 icons on desktop
 - The menu is positioned in the appropriate place (bottom left on windows, top of the screen on android)
 - Apps look consistent
 - Menu contains a flex with content inside it
 - Apps should be able to contain text, an image or a form
 
### JavaScript
 - JS code should be in separate files
 - Icons and menu should use add event listener for the click event, and not the html onclick attribute
 - Functions and variables should have good names
 - Arrow syntax is to be used to declare functions (as per industry standard)

### Github
 - Github is to be used throughout the development and deployment of the project to simulate industry conditions.
 
 ## Summary
 
 ## Tech Stack
